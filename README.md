These programs are available in this repository:

* Neyman_Construction.py

* Numerical_Minimization.py.

# Usage

The usage of these separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy (pyhon)
* scipy.integrate (python)
* sympy (python)

They python files 

* Neyman_Construction.py
* Numerical_Minimization.py

can be run from the Command/Terminal line by typing:

`<> python Neyman_Construction.py `

`<> python Numerical_Minimization.py `

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, seed, scipy.minimize and Matplotlib also installed.
